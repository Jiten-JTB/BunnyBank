 ## Database Initialization

When you run `project.py`, the `initDatabase` function checks for the existence of a database file named `project_database.csv`. If it doesn't exist, the function creates it with necessary headers and sets up the `users` folder for storing user transaction history.

## Transaction History

The application stores user transaction history in the `users` folder. Each user has a separate CSV file containing their transaction records.
